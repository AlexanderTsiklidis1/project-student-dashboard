# Student Dashboard Project

For this assignment, you will build a student dashboard that will make use of already existing data stored in a JSON file. Users will be able to view students in several ways as well as add comments to those students.

Hello, and welcome to my Student Dashboard Project! In this project we were given some data regarding a myriad of different cohorts of an education program. We then used that data to create a React App that displayed the data in a much more clear and concise/accessible manner!

A user of this App will be able to see all of the students that participated in the program, which students participated in which cohort. Which students are "on or off track" based on certain circumstances that our code deals with. 

A user of this app will be able to view some details on each of the students, and a user of this app will be able to comment on a particular students profile or data block.

We hope this app is able to provide you with some insight into the Student Dashboard Project and we hope you enjoy its functionality!
